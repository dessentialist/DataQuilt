1. Warm and personal opening

Lead with a sincere compliment based on your research.

→ "I saw your podcast on [specific topic] and your take on [specific point] stuck with me."

→ "I read your Forbes interview and was moved by how you described [specific thing]."

If you don't mean it, don't say it. Executives can spot fake flattery instantly. They get dozens of emails that start with "I admire your leadership" from people who couldn't name one thing they've done.

The compliment has to be specific enough that it could only apply to them. If you could copy-paste it to another exec, it's too generic.

2. Shared values or struggle

Make it human. Find something that resonates with you personally.

One example that worked: An executive talked about fighting breast cancer and how she applied goal-setting principles to her health journey.

The rep related it to his own approach to time management and personal challenges.

This feels risky. It is. But vulnerability is how you earn trust with senior people. They're surrounded by people who want something from them.

Someone who connects on a human level stands out.

Don't fake this. If nothing resonates, skip to part 3. Forced personal connection is worse than none.

3. Research-backed insight

Cite specific sources. Link to them.

⇢ 10-K filings

⇢ Earnings calls

⇢ Podcasts they appeared on

⇢ Articles or interviews

⇢ Job postings from their company

Show them exactly where you learned what you learned. "I noticed on your Q3 earnings call you mentioned [specific initiative]" hits different than "I know companies like yours are focused on growth."

This builds credibility and proves you did real work. Executives respect preparation. It signals you'll be prepared if they give you a meeting.

4. Sharp point of view with direct linkage

This is where most reps fail. They say generic things like "We help companies like yours" or "We work with similar organizations."

Instead, connect what you do to what they're trying to achieve.

✔ "You're trying to achieve X"
✔ "Companies on that journey often hit Y"
✔ "Here's how we solve it"

One rep selling storage solutions to a bank CEO made this connection: The CEO wasn't focused on storage. She cared about mobile and online banking.

But his pitch was that eliminating hardware refresh cycles would free up budget for those priorities.

That's linkage. You're not selling your product. You're selling how your product enables their goals.

Without this, you're just another vendor asking for time. With it, you're someone who understands their business.

5. Soft CTA with strong conviction

No desperate energy. No begging. No "I know you're busy but..."

→ "If this is a priority, would it make sense to connect?"

→ "Not sure if this resonates, but I'd love to see if you're open to a conversation."

You're offering value, not asking for a favor. The tone should be peer-to-peer, not supplicant-to-executive.

If they don't respond, they don't respond. But desperation in the ask kills deals that the rest of the email earned.
