      'The transaction was structured as a spin-off-plus-merger:[1]\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Prior to closing, Inhibrx completed a spin-off of all non-INBRX-101 assets into a new publicly traded company, Inhibrx Biosciences, Inc. (operating as "Inhibrx").[2][3]\n' +

      '**Stated Rationale**\n' +
      '\n' +
      `According to Sanofi's Head of R&D, Houman Ashrafian: "The addition of INBRX-101 as a high potential asset to our rare disease portfolio reinforces our strategy to commit to differentiated and potential best-in-class products. With our expertise in rare diseases and growing presence in immune-mediated respiratory conditions, INBRX-101 will complement our approach to deploy R&D efforts in key areas of focus and address the needs of the underserved AATD patients and communities."[5] The acquisition was positioned to support Sanofi's portfolio growth strategy and complement its 30-year heritage in rare diseases.[5]\n` +
